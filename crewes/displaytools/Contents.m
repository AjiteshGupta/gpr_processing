% CREWES display tools
%
% Seismic plotting
%  DBSPEC ... compute and plot the Fourier amplitude spectrum of a trace using a decibel scale
%  PLOTIMAGE ... Image display utility for seismic matrices (fast and full featured, new figure window)
%  PLOTSEIS ... Plot a seismic matrix (trace gather) using WTVA format (rudimentary display in current figure)
%  PLOTSEISMIC ... Plot a seismic matrix with WTVA format and UI controls (new figure window)
%  PLOTGATHERS ... Display a suite of seismic gathers in a way that facilitates comparison (new figure window)
%  PLOTSNAPS ... Display a set of wavefield snapshots superimposed on a velocity model (new figure window)
%  PLOTAXES ... Display a set of similar x-y plots in a vertical set of axes for easy comparison (new figure window)
%  WTVA ... plot a seismic trace in wiggle-trace variable-area format
%
% NOTE: PLOTGATHERS, PLOTSNAPS, and PLOTAXES are similar tools that all
% facilitate the anaysis of suites of data. They also make movies and
% PowerPoint slides very easy.  See the help for each of them for more
% information.
